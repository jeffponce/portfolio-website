# Portfolio Website

This was the capstone project for a course on HTML/CSS and SASS. On this project I changed many elements to reflect my skills as I will be using this as my own personal portfolio website. Certain elements, such as the pictures, logo, heading, will be changed further to reflect my work and pictures. On this project we brought together everything I learned. Creating CSS using SASS as a way to write CSS code in a much faster and simplier way. Created transition overlays for our work thumbnails and laid everything out using CSS grid template area and colunms. We also used JavaScript to create a scrolling effect on the main landing page to change the description of myself. We also used media queries to make the site responsive to tablets, Ipad Pro, and Iphone 5-X compatible.
